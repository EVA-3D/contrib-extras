        If you put a pipe `|` followed by a line break you can do a multiline description.
        This supports markdown so you can put a:

        - list
        - image
        - many other

        Go to the [:material-github: source of this file](https://github.com/EVA-3D/contrib-extras/edit/main/docs/index.md) to see how it works.
