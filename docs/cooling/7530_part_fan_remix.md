title: Ed Boston's 7530 Part Fan Mod Remix
---

## Description

> Created by: [Ed Boston](https://github.com/eboston)

This is a remix of the 7530 Part Fan Mod by [Mikkel Schmidt](7530_part_fan.md) with two changes.
  1) Added a second mounting point for the fan
  2) Added a slot for inserting the nuts at the bottom.

I was unable to get the nuts into their location and seated.  I added a slot so the nut can be dropped in easily.

Additional files can be found in [Mikkel Schmidt](7530_part_fan.md) mod.

From [Mikkel Schmidt](7530_part_fan.md):
This mod replaces the Core XY back with a 7530 fan mount to provide additional cooling capacity over the stock 5015. It uses a wider MGN bottom and monster duct from version 2 of [SuperSniffles' Dual 5015 Mod](dual_5015_part_fan.md).
Only supports MGN12 at this time, but is compatible with supersniffles' mgn12_wide bottom, only the split in the middle might decrease performance a tiny bit. Your mileage may vary.

Alternatively you can use the Occam's duct that i made, which also seem to perform very well, especially for low pressure fans. An extra benefit is that it's much less prone to warping at higher temperatures. In fact i've been using a PLA version without issues at 90 degrees bed temperature.
