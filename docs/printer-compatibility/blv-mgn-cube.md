## Description
Mounting kit for the [EVA v2.4](https://eva-3d.github.io/eva-main/) on the [BLV MGN Cube printer](https://www.blvprojects.com/blv-mgn-cube-3d-printer).

The standard EVA hotend carriage was designed for printers using 9mm belts with a different orientation than the BLV MGN Cube. This kit provides all the parts needed to use the EVA on the BLV MGN Cube.

The kit only supports hotends and extruders that are compatible with the original universal face (e.g. not the Titan Aero, which has a dedicated face). It also only supports 6mm timing belts.
