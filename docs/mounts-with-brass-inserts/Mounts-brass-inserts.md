title: top_gun_de's Brass Inserts Remix

## Description:
> Created by: [Detlev Rackow](https://github.com/top-gun)

EVA is designed as a beginner-friendly carriage system, it is based on M3-screws and regular nuts. In some places, brass inserts have advantages over M3-nuts as they can't fall out during upgrades or repairs. Inserting a brass inserts requires a soldering iron, and the inserts are a bit more expensive than the nuts.

These are mounts for the popular Mosquito- and Dragon-hotends. Furthermore, I modified the Corexy-Backplate and the universal faceplate for heat inserts.

These alternative mounts for the Dragon and the Mosquito are modified to replace specific nuts with brass inserts: 
- Probe mount
- Shroud mount
- Fan duct mount

Each mount consists of the main part ("face") and a smaller bottom part ("support"). You need to reprint and exchange both parts.

The fan ducts are optional, you may continue to use your regular nut-mounted fan duct.

You may try thinner heat inserts with 4.6mm OD. Don't use the popular 5.6mm-inserts, the EVA-parts are too delicate for them.

Attention: There is still one M3-nut on the Universal face where the hotend-support gets bolted on. There is not enough plastic to securely hold a brass insert.

You may try thinner heat inserts with 4.6mm OD. Don't use the popular 5.6mm-inserts, the EVA-parts are too delicate for them.
