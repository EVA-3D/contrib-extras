title: Ruffle's E3D V6 & Orbiter 2.85mm Mod

## Description

> Created by: Ruffle

This is a modified EVA 2.4 top plate for the Orbiter F2.85 and an E3D V3 2.85mm Bowden Heatsink.

It will only work with the EVA 2.4 Universal front plate; or possibly later as the notch is a
different size to earlier versions and V2.4 added the additional screws to retain the top plate
to the Universal front plate.

You will need two M3x8 Button Head screws - normal socket head's won't fit as the top of the heatsink will hit them and two M3 heatset inserts for the Orbiter mounting screws. I used Ruthex M3x5.7 for a bit more plastic engagement.

Note:  The F2.85 Orbiter has a different footprint to the V1.5.  Dr Robert Lorincz says that the V2 Orbiter for 1.75mm filament, due Aug '21, will have the same footprint as this F2.85 version.
