An implementation of easymod 1.2.1 using mgn12

The XY joiners are drop in replacement for the official ones.

This will allow you to use your setup with mgn12 in the X axis, mainly redugin the weight of it.

If you are also using mgn12C or MGN12H on the Y axis you'll need the following adapters in place of the original aluminum plates.

You'll need longer M5 screws as this adapters are 3mm thicker than the aluminum part. I recomend printing with more tops/bottoms and higher infill to incease strength.
