Print one EVA mount and one of the frame mounted docks. The M3 Heatsert has bores of 4.8mm diam x 5.5mm tall. The M3_Pilot version has pilot holes for tapped M3 threads.  

You will need one M5x20 screw and T-nut to attach the dock to the frame, and the usual M3 screws to attach the mount to the EVA carraige.
