To that, you attach a hotend face, most of these need a support part, too. Don't mix brass-fitted faces with regular support parts, they won't fit. Fan ducts: These depend on the backplate. I clustered them into the carriage parts, together with the back plates. Probe mounts: Use the regular ones. They have no nut pockets. Shrouds: Use the regular parts. No nut pockets either.","title":"Description:"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#compatible-eva-versions","text":"EVA 2.4.0 or later","title":"Compatible EVA versions"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#carriage","text":"","title":"Carriage"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#bom-carriage","text":"No Qty Name Printable Source 1 1 Universal plate-brass Yes Onshape 2 1 backplate Core XY Yes Onshape 2a 1 backplate Cartesian Yes Onshape 2b 1 backplate CoreXY-dual 5015 Supersniffles Yes Onshape 3 1 Bottom plate MGN12 Yes Onshape 3a 1 Bottom plate Dual 5015 MGN12 Supersniffles Yes Onshape 4 1 Tri-horn fan duct default Yes Onshape 4a 1 Tri-horn fan duct default narrow Yes Onshape 4b 1 Tri-horn fan duct high Yes Onshape 4c 1 Tri-horn fan duct high narrow Yes Onshape 4d 1 Tri-horn fan duct Volcano/Rapido UHF Yes Onshape 4e 1 Dual 5015 Monster horn duct Supersniffles Yes Onshape 4f 1 Dual 5015 Volcano/Rapido UHF duct (Tobi) Yes Onshape 5 ## heat inserts brass M3 x D4.6 x L4 No AliExpress The picture are representative samples to show which holes get inserts.","title":"BOM - Carriage"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#extruders","text":"","title":"Extruders"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#orbiter-15-20-sherpa","text":"OnShape No Qty Name Printable Source 1a 1 Orbiter 1.5 top plate Yes 1b 1 Orbiter 2.0 top plate Yes 1c 1 Sherpa top plate Yes 2 2-3 heat inserts brass M3 x D4.6 x L4 No AliExpress _ You find the Orbiter plate above in the picture of the carriage.","title":"Orbiter 1.5, 2.0, Sherpa"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#hotends","text":"","title":"Hotends"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#mosquito","text":"OnShape No Qty Name Printable Source 1 1 Mosquito face Yes 2 1 Mosquito support Yes 3 6 heat inserts brass M3 x D4.6 x L4 No AliExpress _","title":"Mosquito"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#dragon","text":"","title":"Dragon"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#bom-dragon","text":"OnShape No Qty Name Printable Source 1 1 Dragon face Yes 2 1 Dragon support Yes 3 6 heat inserts brass M3 x D4.6 x L4 No AliExpress _","title":"BOM - Dragon"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#dragonfly-bmo","text":"","title":"Dragonfly BMO"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#bom-dragonfly-bmo","text":"OnShape No Qty Name Printable Source 1 1 Dragonfly BMO face Yes 2 1 Dragonfly BMO support Yes 3 6 heat inserts brass M3 x D4.6 x L4 No AliExpress _ Sorry no picture, refer to the Dragon photo","title":"BOM - Dragonfly BMO"},{"location":"mounts-with-brass-inserts/Mounts-brass-inserts/#bom-rapido","text":"OnShape No Qty Name Printable Source 1 1 Rapido face (no support required) Yes 2 6 heat inserts brass M3 x D4.6 x L4 No AliExpress _ Note: The Rapido in HF configuration (V6 nozzles) can use all regular fan ducts, i.e. Tri-horn-duct.
